# car price predcition project
In this project I develop the model which predict the price of car on some features. There are 14 different features releted house I collected as a data.

Libraries Used in project :-

1. Pandas
2. Numpy
3. Scikit-learn
4. Matplot lib
5. joblib

Import .csv file in jupyter notebook and first perform some Pandas library function on that data to maka perfect. we can get deep details about our data using .info() function.

With the help of numpy i got the mathimatical details of data which is helpfull further. i got count, min, max, standard deviation etc details of data. i used random function to arrange data randomly . i make the different histograms for analyse the data.

Then i split the data into train set and test set with the help of sklearn.model_selection. i use train_test_split for spliting data. Now check the correlation of functions and make the plots of some relevent features. According plots trying out features combinations.
